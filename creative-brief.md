# Creative Brief

I need a real template here eventually but in short the idea of the creative brief is to give the overall idea of what the branding project is for and how it's targeting etc. 

In this case, I'm putting this together for TWC Austin and I'm primarily doing it because if I'm going to be making a bunch of templates etc for social media purposes I might as well also get that effort towards this broader project I've been working on.
