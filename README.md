# Branding Toolkit

This is a git repo for the graphic design elements of the Austin branch of Tech Worker's Coalition. It is a fork of the [Open Source Branding](https://github.com/jcklpe/Open-Source-Branding) toolkit, a personal project by [Aslan French](https://jackalope.tech) with the intention of demonstrating an open source approach to branding and graphic design which is driven by decentralized tools like git.

All current forks of the Open Source Branding project are works in progress and will eventually have their baseline structure folded back into the master branch as those projects reach maturity. The intended use case of the master branch is to eventually provide a straightforward way for open source and non-profit projects to fork their own branch and instantly have a well organized branding kit ready to customize for their own needs.
