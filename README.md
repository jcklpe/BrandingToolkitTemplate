# Branding Toolkit

This is a base file git repo to be included as a submodule in the the larger Open Source Branding project: https://github.com/jcklpe/Open-Source-Branding

This will server as a boilerplate starting point for all branding projects and all those projects will be forked from this one.

Replace this file with the contents of the creative brief for specific projects.

## TODO:

- [ ] adding template files
- [ ] flesh out explanations in markdown files
